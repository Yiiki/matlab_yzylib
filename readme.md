## ``read_unform_uneven.m``

Read unformatted 3D volume data file generated by Fortran.

1. MATLAB read in the unformatted file in "stream" way, but in Fortran, there is "sequential" way by defaul.

The latter will automatically cope with the head and tail information to read in correct length of data;

However, it becomes user's duty when reading in "stream" way.

Remember, the ``write`` statement in Fortran should be interpreted as three parts with "stream" mode:

-- head info (a 4-byte integer ``m``), which stores the number of content followed thereafter

-- data itself ( m x n-byte integer/real/complex )

-- tail info (a 4-byte integer ``m``), which should be equal with the ``m`` in head info

Writing a unformatted read-in program with MATLAB should rely on the details of Fortran-written code.

However, sometimes things go crazy: you just receive unreasonable content even if you done "right".

Such as, you think you have written same length of data according to code, but actually, they are not.

At this time, the only reliable way is to print out the binary content of the file to be read.

Such as the tools of ``hex2int32.m`` or ``hex2real8.m`` listed above.
